# Amazon_review_helpfulness_prediction PYSPARK EDITION
this is my repository for the Amazon Review Helpfulness prediction model project using Pyspark for ML and data cleaning.  
_last updated: 10/20/2017_  
  
## OBJECTIVE:
The motivation here is to repeat/improve what I did for the Amazon review helpfulness prediction all in pyspark.  
  
### BUT WHY?
1. spark can do data cleaning and tfidf and machine learning computationally faster.  
2. Learning experience. I want to learn more about Spark, Hive, SQL and learn how to handle large dataset for a data science project.  
   
## Notes:
unlike my previous project, on this repo, I will post lots of notes.  
I figure that there aren't much stackoverflow postings on pyspark compare to other language that Spark can handle (scala, Java).  
So I want to put notes on my repo just so that it can maybe help someone who is new to spark (just like myself).
